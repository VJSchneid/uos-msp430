# ÂµOS - lightweight cooperative operation system for microcontrollers

For now this system is experimental and just supports the ``MSP430FR2433`` microcontroller.
Hopefully more architectures are getting supported over time, but currently this project is WIP.

This system is focuses on small executable sizes.
